corncoin - Made by some Cornell people


- Software for interfacing miners with some centralized database that links them to the other miners, as well as any pending blocks
-   Need to be able to update all other miners with any proof-of-works discovered
-   Need to be able to propogate new blockchain to other miners
- Software for interfacing the avg user (non-miner) with this database so their transactions can be added to the next (un-solved) block
-   This should be simple to use
